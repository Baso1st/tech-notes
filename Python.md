- Python doesn't have do-while. Instead you can use while true a condition at the end to break
  ```python
    While True:
      //Do Something
      if (condition):
        break
  ```
  - The Keyword **pass** does nothing. It is useful to use to have an empty function or empty loop. 
  - Adjacent strings in python are concatenated!. So ```"String A " "String B"``` is equal to ```"String A String B"```
